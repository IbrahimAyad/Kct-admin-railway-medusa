```

### 5. Deploy the Application

```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway deploy

# Follow the deployment logs
railway logs
```

### 6. Run Database Migrations

After successful deployment:

```bash
# Run Medusa migrations
railway run npm run migrate

# Optional: Seed database with initial data
railway run npm run seed
```

### 7. Configure Domain (Optional)

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Add custom domain (e.g., `api.kctmenswear.com`)
3. Update CORS settings to include your custom domain

## üîß Configuration Details

### Required Files Created

- ‚úÖ `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration
- ‚úÖ `Dockerfile` - Container configuration (already exists)
- ‚úÖ `.env.production.template` - Production environment template
- ‚úÖ Updated `medusa-config.js` with GA4 integration

### Database Configuration

Railway automatically provides:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string

These are automatically injected into your application.

### GA4 Integration

The backend is configured with:
- **Measurement ID**: `G-LH26GTWFQS`
- **Server-side tracking** for e-commerce events
- **Enhanced e-commerce** tracking (purchases, cart events, etc.)

## üåç Access Points

After deployment, your application will be available at:

- **API Base**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/admin`
- **Store API**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/store`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/admin/system/health`

## üîê Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Required Security Steps

1. **Generate New Secrets**: Replace all development secrets with production-grade keys
2. **Update CORS**: Configure proper CORS origins for production domains
3. **SSL/TLS**: Railway provides HTTPS by default
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure no sensitive data in code
5. **API Keys**: Use production API keys for all external services

### üîë Generate Production Secrets

```bash
# Generate secure random secrets (32+ characters)
node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log('COOKIE_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log('SESSION_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   railway logs --deployment
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set
   - Check database service status
   - Run migrations: `railway run npm run migrate`

3. **Redis Connection Issues**
   - Verify `REDIS_URL` is set
   - Check Redis service status

4. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables
   ```

5. **Health Check Failures**
   - Check application logs
   - Verify port 9000 is exposed
   - Test health endpoint

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View application logs
railway logs

# View environment variables
railway variables

# Run commands in production environment
railway run <command>

# Connect to production database
railway connect postgres

# Connect to Redis
railway connect redis
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Built-in Monitoring

- **Railway Dashboard**: Monitor deployments, logs, and metrics
- **Health Checks**: Automatic health monitoring at `/admin/system/health`
