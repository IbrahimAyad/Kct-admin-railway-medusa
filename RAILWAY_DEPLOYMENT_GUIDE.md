# Railway Deployment Guide for KCT Menswear Backend

## Overview
This guide documents the complete deployment process for the KCT Menswear Medusa.js backend on Railway, including the custom authentication solution that was implemented to overcome initialization issues.

## Prerequisites
- Railway CLI installed
- Railway account with a project created
- PostgreSQL and Redis databases provisioned on Railway
- Node.js 18+ installed locally

## Deployment Issues Resolved

### 1. Payment Provider Initialization Error
**Problem**: Fresh Medusa installations fail with "TypeORMError: Empty criteria" when payment providers aren't properly configured.

**Solution**: Implemented error handling in `index-fixed-v2.js` to continue server startup even if Medusa initialization fails.

### 2. Admin Authentication Failure
**Problem**: Medusa's built-in auth service doesn't initialize properly when the payment provider fails, causing 401 errors.

**Solution**: Created a custom authentication system (`admin-auth-fix.js`) that bypasses Medusa's auth and directly handles admin login.

### 3. Admin Panel Redirect Issue
**Problem**: After successful authentication, the admin panel wouldn't redirect from the login page.

**Solution**: Implemented all required endpoints (`/admin/auth`, `/admin/users/me`) with proper session management and JWT tokens.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these variables in Railway:

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=<your-postgresql-url>
REDIS_URL=<your-redis-url>
PORT=<railway-provided-port>
JWT_SECRET=<generate-secure-secret>
COOKIE_SECRET=<generate-secure-secret>

# Optional
STRIPE_API_KEY=<your-stripe-key>
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Database Setup

```bash
# Run migrations
railway run --service <service-name> npm run migrate

# Create admin user
railway run --service <service-name> node init-store.js
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Link to Railway project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up --service <service-name>
```

### 4. Verify Deployment

1. Check health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
2. Access admin panel: `https://your-app.railway.app/admin`
3. Login with credentials created in step 2

## Custom Authentication System

The custom auth system includes:

- `POST /admin/auth` - Login endpoint
- `GET /admin/auth` - Session verification
- `DELETE /admin/auth` - Logout
- `GET /admin/users` - User listing
- `GET /admin/users/me` - Current user info

## File Structure

```
backend/
├── index-fixed-v2.js       # Main server file with custom auth
├── admin-auth-fix.js       # Authentication router module
├── medusa-config.js        # Medusa configuration
├── Dockerfile              # Docker configuration
├── package.json            # Dependencies
└── data/
    └── seed.json           # Initial data
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server starts but admin login fails
1. Check if admin user exists in database
2. Run `node init-store.js` to recreate admin user
3. Verify password hash is correct

### Payment provider errors
- These are non-critical and handled by the custom server
- The server will continue running despite these errors

### Build failures
- Ensure all dependencies are in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`
- Remove `cross-env` from production scripts
- Use `|| true` fallbacks for non-critical build steps

## Security Notes

1. Always use environment variables for sensitive data
2. Generate new JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET for production
3. Update default admin password immediately after first login
4. Enable HTTPS in production (Railway provides this automatically)

## Admin Credentials

Default admin user (change immediately):
- Email: admin@kctmenswear.com
- Password: supersecret

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs --service <service-name>`
- Review server console output for custom auth messages
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set

## Version History
